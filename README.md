# Stairmaster

Write a function, stairmaster(n), that will compute the number of ways to climb a flight of n steps, taking 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time.

Take the example of climbing n = 4 steps. There are seven different ways one can climb four stairs using 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time: [1,1,1,1] [2,1,1] [1,2,1] [1,1,2] [2,2] [1,3] [3,1].

Make sure to find all permutations, not combinations, as the order matters. Climbing one step then two steps is different from climbing two steps then one step.
